Hey,

  Long time ago that i talked with most of you, hopefully you're all doing
  well and are having fun with your current endeavours :)

  As a bit of background of why i'm mailing you all, we're building a logger
  service for Telepathy. This allows any IM conversation done via telepathy
  (whether it be in gnome shell, Empathy or whatever) to be automagically
  logged. Part of this service will be a little library one can use for writing
  log viewers.

  The current storage backend is based on the logging code from Empathy, which
  in turn has its origins in Gossip. Which means the library needs has to be
  GPL currently, which is not great for obvious reasons. Hence we were
  wondering if there is a possibility to relicense this code to LGPL v2.1+

  To be more specific we tracked the code down the follow files from Gossip:
    libgossip/gossip-time.c:
      Copyright: Imendio AB
      Main Author is Richard with contributions from Mikael and Martyn

    libgossip/gossip-log.c:
      Copyright: Imendio AB
      No main author in the license header, code mostly written by Martyn
      with contributions from Richard and Mikael

  So what it in the end comes down to is: would you be happy to relicense this
  code such that we can use it under the LGPL v2.1+ and are you able to make
  that decision on behalf of Imendio AB (which from a legal perspective own
  the copyrights ttbomk)

  Sjoerd

Micke and I are fine with relicensing any Imendio and/or personally owned code in the mentioned files to LGPL v2.1+. I can make that decision on behalf of Imendio AB (now known as Tinybird Interactive AB).

Cheers,
Richard

Both of you contributed to empathy-log-store-empathy. Would you agree to

I'm not a license expert so I don't exactly know why GPL is not ok for
this log service.
So I just trust your decision.

We want libtelepathy-logger to be LGPL instead of GPL so non-GPL
application can link to it.
That's also a requirement for libraries in the GNOME platform.
